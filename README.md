This is a new version of the Network Traffic Generator rewritten using C++11 techniques. For information on the previous version take a look at [traffic](http://robert.rsa3.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Projects.Traffic). Currently working on getting feature parity with the older version.

GPLv2 license, serious work in progress.

Currently builds on my Mac OS X, Ubuntu 14 LTS and CentOS 7 systems.
